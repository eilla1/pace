  <h1 class="text-center">Our Mission and Goals</h1>

  <p>Our mission is to help people experiencing PTSD cope with their emotions, psychological, and social wellness. Through interactive activities, resources, and information we hope users will feel less stress and more positivity especially during these uncertain times.</p>
  
  <p>Mental health is an aspect that affects each and every one of us. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it makes up our “emotional, psychological, and social well being.” Did you know that mental health conditions are very common with there being more than 50% being diagnosed sometime in their life? Potential factors that can contribute to an individual developing a mental health related condition include trauma, history of abuse, loneliness, and alcohol or drugs. </p>

  <p>
    One specific mental health condition that PACE is focusing on is called PTSD, which stands for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. It is triggered by a momentous event in an individual’s life with them being witnessing or victim to, according to the Mayo Clinic. Generally, when an individual is diagnosed with PTSD, self-care and time can help them recover. In the long run, their PTSD can get worse, and as a result, this condition can affect their daily life. 
  </p>

  <p>Symptoms can be grouped into four types:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Intrusive memories (can include haunting images, nightmares, flashbacks, etc)</li>
    <li>Avoidance (dismissing thoughts or discussion about the traumatic event, avoiding places, activities, and people connected to the event as well)</li>
    <li>Negative changes (includes mood and thoughts) </li>
    <li>Emotional/Physical reactions are different from before </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Prevalence is defined as the “proportion of people in a population that have a given disorder at a given time” (PTSD.va.gov). The U.S National Center for PTSD says that research has shown that children exposed to traumatic events may potentially have “a higher prevalence of PTSD than adults in the general population.”</p>
   
  <p>
    PTSD doesn’t always occur when a child or teen experiences trauma and symptoms may show up after several months or even years afterwards. A diagnosis is only made when the noted symptoms are consistent for more than a month or the child/teen’s life is negatively affected. 

  </p>
  
  <p>
    It’s not the end of the world if a child or teen is diagnosed with PTSD. The sooner they are diagnosed, the better it is for their physical, mental, and emotional health. Potential treatments include CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) and medications for depession or anxiety.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder affects all ages and is visible in the background of our everyday society. We have to work towards improving our mindset behind mental health and helping those who are struggling with the effects of PTSD by providing more resources. The first step begins by taking the time to learn more about it.
